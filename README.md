# Caissa-chan

This is a simple discord bot that converts [FEN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth%E2%80%93Edwards_Notation) into an image.

To get started, add it to a discord server and then send a message on the server as the following:

`!FEN rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b`

The bot will reply to you message with an image of the chess board with the position in the FEN, and will announce whose turn it is too.

This bot was originally made for the discord server, The Chess Loft.
